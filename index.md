<h3><strong>What if our progress as a society hinged on the blunt sum of our collective struggles and aspirations?<br/>
What if we could infuence that progress by helping each sentient participant in our society maximize their contribution?<br/>
What if the destiny of our society required an astronomically large number of fully maximized sentients?<br/>
Would it take 1 billion maximized sentients? 1 trillion? 1 quadrillion? Maybe even 1 quintillion?
